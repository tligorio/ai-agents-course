## Tutorials

### 1. Simple AI Workflow with Reflection using OpenRouter
In this demo, we build a simple AI workflow that demonstrates the reflection pattern using three LLM personas working together to produce a polished report.

### 2. Simple AI Workflow with RAG using OpenRouter and Supabase
In this demo, we build a simple AI workflow that demonstrates the **Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)** pattern — a technique that grounds LLM responses in specific documentation, reducing hallucinations and enabling the model to answer questions about information not in its training data.

### 3. ReAct Agent with Hugging Face Transformers - No Frameworks, No paid APIs
Build an agent that reasons step-by-step and uses tools to solve problems, from scratch (framework-free). Uses open-source models.

### 4. ReAct Agent with LangChain - Framework Approach -COMING SOON
Build a ReAct agent using LangChain's components. Compare how tool integration, prompting, and execution differ from the manual implementation.

### 5. Multi-Agent Collaboration with LangGraph -COMING SOON
Build a system with multiple specialized agents working together, each handling different sub-tasks and tools. Explore LangGraph's graph-based orchestration.
